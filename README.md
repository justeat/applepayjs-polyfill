# Apple Pay JS Polyfill

This repository contains a polyfill for [Apple Pay JS](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs) for use for testing on devices that do not natively support Apple Pay JS.

## Overview

Apple Pay JS is a way of accepting Apple Pay in websites using Safari in either iOS 10 and macOS for users who have a TouchID compatible device.

This polyfill provides a way to make [```ApplePaySession```](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/applepaysession) available for testing your implementation in browsers that would otherwise not provide support for Apple Pay JS, such as in Chrome on Windows.
